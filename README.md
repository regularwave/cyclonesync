# CycloneSync

## Description

No ads, no sign-ups, and no having to touch another person's phone!

CycloneSync is a comprehensive personal tracker (mana pool, commander tax, commander damage) that features synchronized life totals for pods.

### Why?

Traditional digital trackers require placing a single phone or tablet in the center of the table. This can lead to issues with screen glare, awkwardly reaching across the play area, and the requirement to physically handle other people's devices.

CycloneSync provides the shared, synchronized life totals of a centralized tracker, while allowing every player to securely manage their own board state from their own device.

### Easy Setup

To make things easy at the table, CycloneSync is designed to make setup quick:
* **No downloads:** Runs entirely in the browser.
* **No accounts:** No sign-ups, emails, or logins required.
* **Quick connection:** Players can join a synchronized pod in seconds by scanning a QR code or entering a short room name.

## Features

* **Real-time Life Sync:** View the current life totals of up to three other players in your pod instantly.
* **Comprehensive Personal Tracking:** Locally track your own commander damage (including partner commanders), commander tax, and floating mana without cluttering the shared view.
* **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Install directly to your device home screen for a native, full-screen app experience. Includes an optional screen wake-lock toggle and an automatic idle timeout to preserve device battery life.
